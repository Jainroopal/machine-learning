check the cuda version by this cmd $ dpkg -l | grep cuda-toolkit
Install Cudnn according to your Cuda version from https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive.

UNZIP the tar file using cmd $ tar -xzvf cudnn-x.x-linux-x64-v8.x.x.x.tgz

Copy the following files into the CUDA Toolkit directory.
$ sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda/include 
$ sudo cp -P cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64 

Finally: add read permission to both these target directory
$ sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*


Once you finish, you have to add the CUDA path to your ~/.bashrc file. Open

$ echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/include:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

Then reload .bashrc by running:
source ~/.bashrc
